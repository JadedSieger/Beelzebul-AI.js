# Beelzebul-AI.JS

Beelzebul-AI.JS is the Javascript Build for our already developed Python Version.

### Requirements
- latest version of node.js
- latest version of discord.js
- Visual Studio Code (Optional)
### Installation
1. `Installing Dependecies`
 npm i
2. `Setting up Variables`
 replace the "openai_api_key" and "bot_token" values with your own values
 If you are using replit.com or other hosting websites, you may instead opt for storing both variables in ENV.
3. `Setting up your prompts`
> In the ```let prompt =``` field, you may use as much prompts as you would like to make the bot reply in a more convincing way.

### Initialization 
Running with an IDE is preferred. However, if you want to run from the Command Line, navigate to your target location with your copy of index.js with `cd <path>`, before running `node index.js`
